[Use authorial modesty.]

Volume 1 - Settings

[A language extension is required to set the following variable correctly:]

The language of play is the Spanish language.

[The following only needs to be done for inflected languages which distinguish
the genders -- which is why English doesn't do it.]

An object has a grammatical gender. [todo: revisar que esto haga falta]

[Inform initialises this property sensibly. We can easily check the results:

	When play begins:
		repeat with T running through things:
			say "[T] has [grammatical gender of T]."

By default, if Inform can't see any reason to choose a particular gender,
it will use neuter. We want to change that for French, since French doesn't
have neuter nouns:]


The grammatical gender of an object is usually masculine gender.
The grammatical gender of a woman is usually feminine gender.

A thing can be female. [for spanish: Habilita genero a inanimados, como containers, supporters, etc. Caracteristica necesaria en espanol]
A room can be female. [for spanish: Habilita genero a habitaciones. Caracteristica necesaria (a veces) en espanol, sobre todo al listar las habitaciones.]
A room can be plural-named or singular-named. [for spanish: al listar rooms como 'las Escaleras']

Section 1 SR Hack - Spanish Bibliographical Data (in place of Section 7 - Unindexed Standard Rules variables -  in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)
[el 'is usually' no deja redefinir de nuevo por defecto las constantes, por lo que hay que hackearlo]

The story title, the story author, the story headline, the story genre
and the story description are text variables. [*****]
The release number and the story creation year are number variables. [**]

The release number is usually 1.
The story headline is usually "Un relato interactivo".
The story genre is usually "Ficción".

The story title variable translates into Inter as "Story".

Section 2 SR Hack - Others Hackings

[Para poner siempre el nombre de la habitaci?n con primera letra en mayuscula (johan mode):]

Carry out looking (this is the spanish room description heading rule):
	say bold type;
	if the visibility level count is 0:
		begin the printing the name of a dark room activity;
		if handling the printing the name of a dark room activity:
			say "Oscuridad" (A);
		end the printing the name of a dark room activity;
	otherwise if the visibility ceiling is the location:
		johan mode "[visibility ceiling]";
	otherwise:
		say "[The visibility ceiling]";
	say roman type;
	let intermediate level be the visibility-holder of the actor;
	repeat with intermediate level count running from 2 to the visibility level count:
		if the intermediate level is a supporter or the intermediate level is an animal:
			say " (sobre [the intermediate level])" (B);
		otherwise:
			say " (en [the intermediate level])" (C);
		let the intermediate level be the visibility-holder of the intermediate level;
	say line break;
	say run paragraph on with special look spacing.

The spanish room description heading rule is listed instead of the room description heading rule in the carry out looking rules. 

To johan mode (T - text):
	let X be the number of words in T;
	say word number 1 in T in sentence case;
	repeat with counter running from 2 to X:
		say " [word number counter in T]".


Section 3 SR Hack - Spanish People (in place of Section 11 - People in Standard Rules by Graham Nelson)
[el 'is usually' no deja redefinir las constantes, por lo que hay que hackearlo]

The specification of person is "A pesar de su nombre, no necesariamente se trata de un ser humano, sino de cualquier ente con las funciones necesarias como para interactuar con él."


A person can be female or male. A person is usually male.
A person can be neuter. A person is usually not neuter.

A person has a number called carrying capacity.
The carrying capacity of a person is usually 100.

A person can be transparent. A person is always transparent.

The yourself is an undescribed person. The yourself is proper-named.

The yourself is privately-named.
Understand "your former self" or "my former self" or "former self" or
	"former" as yourself when the player is not yourself.

[The description of yourself is usually "As good-looking as ever."]

Understand "tu antiguo yo" or "mi antiguo yo" or "antiguo yo" as yourself when the player is not yourself.

The description of yourself is usually "Tan buen aspecto como siempre."[infsp hacking]

The yourself object translates into Inter as "selfobj".

Volume 2 - Language

Part 2.1 - Determiners

Chapter 2.1.1 - Articles


To say el (O - object):
	say "[the O]".

To say un (O - object):
	say "[a O]".

To say El (O - object):
	say "[The O]".

To say Un (O - object):
	say "[A O]".


Part 2.2 - Nouns

Chapter 2.2.2 - Pronouns and possessives for the player 

[The adaptive text viewpoint is the viewpoint of the player when we are
writing response texts which need to work in any tense, person or number.
For example, English uses first person plural, so we write "[We] [look] up."
as a message which could come out as "I look up", "you look up", "he looks up",
and so on. It's "[We]" not "[You]" because the adaptive text viewpoint is
first person plural, not second person singular.

The reason for choosing this in English was that all the pronouns and
possessive adjectives we needed happened to be different for first person
plural: we, us, ours, ourselves, our. We also need these pronouns to be
other than third-person, so that we can define [they], [them] and so on
to refer to objects and not the player. So in practice there are only four
possible choices a language extension can make:

	first person singular (in English: I, me, mine, myself, my)
	second person plural (in English: you, you, yours, yourself, your)
	first person singular (in English: we, us, ours, ourselves, our)
	second person plural (in English: you, you, yours, yourself, your)

What shall we choose for French? We may as well use second person singular,
giving us tu, te, le tien/la tienne, te, ton. There are two complications.
Firstly we need indirect objects as well as direct objects, and although these
are the same in second person (te and te), they're different in third person
(le and lui). We'll call this "[te-lui]" for the same of this demonstration,
which is a bit awkward, but it'll do. Secondly, the reflexive pronoun is also
te, so we'll write that one "[te-se]".
Spanish: We use 2PS.
]

The adaptive text viewpoint of the Spanish language is second person singular.

[So now we define the following text substitutions:

French:[tu], [te], [te-lui], [te-se], [le tien], [ton]

Spanish: [tu], [ti], [tuyo], [le tien], [ton]

and their capitalised forms, which start with "T" not "t".]

To decide which number is wdnum of (T - text) with length (N - number):
	(- DictionaryWordFromText({T}, {N}) -).

To decide which snippet is the invalid snippet:
	(- 0 -).

SearchingFor is a snippet based rulebook producing a number.

SearchingFor a snippet (called W):
	if W is the invalid snippet, rule fails;
	let converted text be the substituted form of "[W]";

	repeat through the Table of Irregular Verbs:[search in a table for replace the player`s command]

	let rv be wdnum of auxiliary response with length (number of characters in auxiliary response);
	rule succeeds with result rv.
